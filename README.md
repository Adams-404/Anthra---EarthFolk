# 🌍 Anthra

Where humanity's stories, traditions, and identities converge on a living, breathing globe.

## 🧠 What is Anthra?

Anthra is an interactive 3D experience that lets you explore the cultures, languages, rituals, myths, and heritage of people from every corner of the Earth — all through an elegant, rotating globe.

It's not a history book or a textbook.  
It's a portal into human experience.

## 🌐 What You Can Do on Anthra

- Spin the globe, click any country or region
- Dive into its cultural DNA:
  - Hear local music or spoken language
  - View traditional garments, masks, crafts
  - Read or listen to folk tales, myths, or rituals
  - Discover festivals, dances, cuisine, and belief systems
  - Compare how similar customs appear across distant cultures
  - Understand how people celebrate, grieve, pray, live, and love

## 🌱 Why It Matters

The world is forgetting things:  
Languages are dying. Traditions are vanishing.  
Young generations are growing up disconnected from their ancestral roots.

Anthra exists to reverse that.  
To preserve and present the world's living cultures — not just facts, but feelings.  
It connects you to others, but also to yourself — your identity, your origin.

## 🎯 Who It's For

- Learners & wanderers who want to explore the world deeply
- Diaspora communities reconnecting with their heritage
- Educators teaching global awareness
- Cultural enthusiasts looking beyond surface-level tourism

## ✨ The Experience

You don't scroll.  
You don't just watch.

You orbit, zoom, and step into the soul of a people.  
Anthra isn't about where countries are — it's about who lives there, and why it matters.
